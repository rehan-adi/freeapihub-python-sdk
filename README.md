    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching books: {e}")

asyncio.run(fetch_books())

```

### Example 2: Fetch a Book by ID

```python
import asyncio
from freeapihub import get_book_by_id

async def fetch_book(book_id: str):
    try:
        book = await get_book_by_id(book_id)
        print(book)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching book with ID {book_id}: {e}")

asyncio.run(fetch_book("book-id-here"))
```
